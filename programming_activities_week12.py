"""
Programming Activity 1

Write a program which asks the user for two numbers, stored in two variables num1 and num2. 
Generate a multiplication table for all integers 1 through num1 and 1 through num2. 
The bottom right entry in your table should have the product of num1 and num2. 
The table must be stored in a 2D list. 
The list must be created first with a nested for loop. 
Then, the table should be printed by another nested for loop iterating through the 2D list.
Steps:
- store the variables.
- create a list, and add empty lists to the list - however many your need from the variables above.
- append the values to the lists.
- use a nested for loop to iterate through the list and print the values.

for i in range(num2):
    lst2.append(i)
print(lst)
print(f"lst: {lst}")
print(f"lst2: {lst2}")


"""
Programming Activity 2

Write a program which asks the user their age and favorite color.  
Store these values in a dictionary with keys "age" and "favorite_color".  
Also save the 2D list from the previous activity in the dictionary with the 
key "multiplication_table".
print all the values in the dictionary by iterating through the keys 
using a for loop.

"""
Programming Activity 3

Write a program, which loads a json file "person.json" into a Python 
dictionary. Change the contents of person["age"] by adding 1. Save the 
updated dictionary to person.json, and verify the contents of person.json 
have been updated.
- load person.json in to a Python dictionary using the json.load() function
- update the value of person["age"], increase by 1
- save the Python dictionary to person.json
- open person.json and verify the "age" value has increased by 1

"""
Programming Activity 4

Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. In a try statement, 
attempt to divide number 1 by number 2.  If number 2 is a 0, print a 
message in the except statement saying "Error, attempted to divide by zero"
- create two variables, inputted by the user
- in a  try: block attempt to divide num1 by num2
- in a except: block print a message indicating divide by zero error
- end program
